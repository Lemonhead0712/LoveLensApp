        <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mb-3 text-purple-700">Our Mission & Vision</h2>
        <p className="mb-3 text-gray-700">
          At Love Lens, we help couples build stronger relationships through data-driven insights and emotional
          intelligence. We believe understanding communication patterns is the first step toward meaningful growth and
          deeper connection. Our AI analyzes conversation patterns without storing private messages, providing a safe
          way to gain insights into relationship dynamics.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700">
          We envision technology as a bridge to deeper human connection. Love Lens represents our commitment to using AI
          ethically to strengthen bonds between partners, making relationship insights accessible to everyoneâ€”whether or
          not they have access to traditional counseling.

        <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mb-3 text-purple-700">Our Approach</h2>
        <p className="mb-3 text-gray-700">
          Love Lens combines research-backed relationship science (Gottman Method, attachment theory, communication
          studies) with advanced natural language processing to identify patterns that might otherwise go unnoticed.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700">
          What sets us apart: we analyze screenshots locally and never store message content. Your conversations are
          processed in memory and automatically deleted after analysis. We provide insights about patterns, not
          judgments about specific exchanges.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mb-3 text-purple-700">Our Team</h2>
        <p className="text-gray-700">
          Love Lens was founded by Lamar Newsome, a relationship coach with over 15 years of experience. Our team
          includes relationship therapists, AI researchers, and software engineers who share a passion for using
          technology to foster human connection. We regularly consult with relationship psychology experts to refine our
          analysis and recommendations.
