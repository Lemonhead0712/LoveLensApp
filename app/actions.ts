    communicationStylesAndEmotionalTone: {
      description: `The conversational landscape between ${subjectALabel} and ${subjectBLabel} reveals a rich tapestry of emotional expression and relational negotiation. ${subjectALabel}'s communication style tends toward direct emotional articulation, often initiating vulnerable disclosures and seeking explicit reassurance. Their messages frequently contain emotional markers—expressions of care, concern, or uncertainty—that invite deeper engagement. In contrast, ${subjectBLabel} demonstrates a more measured approach, offering thoughtful responses that balance emotional support with practical perspective. The interplay between these styles creates a dynamic where ${subjectALabel}'s emotional expressiveness meets ${subjectBLabel}'s stabilizing presence, though this complementarity occasionally generates tension when needs for validation and space diverge. The overall emotional tone oscillates between warmth and tension, reflecting a relationship actively working through the challenges of emotional attunement while maintaining underlying affection.`,

      subjectAStyle: `${subjectALabel}, as the conversation initiator and screenshot sharer, exhibits a communication style characterized by emotional transparency and relational vigilance. Their messages often carry an undercurrent of seeking reassurance, with frequent check-ins about the relationship's status and their partner's feelings. This pattern suggests an anxious-leaning attachment orientation, where connection is maintained through active engagement and emotional disclosure. ${subjectALabel} tends to use emotionally charged language, employing phrases that convey both affection and concern. Their communication rhythm shows a preference for frequent contact and quick responses, indicating that consistent interaction serves as a primary means of feeling secure in the relationship. When conflict arises, ${subjectALabel} typically moves toward engagement rather than withdrawal, sometimes escalating emotional intensity in an effort to resolve tension quickly.`,

      subjectBStyle: `${subjectBLabel}, positioned as the conversation partner, demonstrates a communication approach marked by thoughtful consideration and emotional modulation. Their responses tend to be more measured and less immediately reactive, suggesting a communication style that values processing time before engaging with emotionally charged topics. ${subjectBLabel} often provides reassurance while simultaneously maintaining boundaries, a pattern that can be both stabilizing and occasionally frustrating for a partner seeking more immediate emotional validation. Their messages reveal a preference for practical problem-solving alongside emotional support, sometimes offering solutions when ${subjectALabel} may be seeking empathetic listening. This style suggests a more avoidant-leaning attachment pattern, where autonomy is preserved through careful emotional regulation and strategic engagement. ${subjectBLabel}'s communication rhythm shows comfort with longer response intervals, viewing space as compatible with connection rather than threatening to it.`,

      regulationPatternsObserved: `Emotional regulation within this dyad follows distinct patterns for each partner. ${subjectALabel} tends toward external regulation strategies, seeking co-regulation through partner engagement and explicit reassurance. When distressed, they move toward connection, using communication as a primary tool for managing anxiety and restoring emotional equilibrium. ${subjectBLabel}, conversely, demonstrates more internal regulation strategies, often taking time to process emotions independently before responding. This difference in regulation styles can create a pursue-withdraw dynamic, where ${subjectALabel}'s bids for connection may inadvertently trigger ${subjectBLabel}'s need for space, which in turn amplifies ${subjectALabel}'s anxiety. However, both partners show capacity for self-awareness and adjustment, occasionally breaking these patterns with successful repair attempts.`,

      messageRhythmAndPacing: `The conversational cadence between ${subjectALabel} and ${subjectBLabel} reveals important insights about their relational dynamics. ${subjectALabel} typically initiates exchanges and maintains a faster response tempo, often sending multiple messages in succession when emotionally activated. This rapid-fire pattern suggests both engagement and anxiety, with message frequency increasing during moments of relational uncertainty. ${subjectBLabel}'s pacing is notably more deliberate, with longer intervals between responses that may reflect either thoughtful consideration or emotional distancing, depending on context. This asymmetry in rhythm can create tension, as ${subjectALabel} may interpret delays as disengagement while ${subjectBLabel} experiences pressure from the expectation of immediate response. The most harmonious exchanges occur when both partners find a middle ground—${subjectALabel} allowing space for processing, and ${subjectBLabel} offering more frequent check-ins to maintain connection.`,
    },

    reflectiveFrameworks: {
      description: `Examining ${subjectALabel} and ${subjectBLabel}'s interaction through established psychological frameworks reveals deeper patterns that shape their relational experience. These theoretical lenses illuminate not just what happens in their communication, but why certain dynamics persist and how they might be transformed through awareness and intentional practice.`,

      attachmentEnergies: `The attachment dynamics between ${subjectALabel} and ${subjectBLabel} reflect a classic anxious-avoidant pairing, though with notable flexibility that suggests secure functioning is accessible to both partners under optimal conditions. ${subjectALabel}'s attachment system activates through proximity-seeking behaviors—frequent contact, explicit requests for reassurance, and heightened sensitivity to perceived distance. Their internal working model appears to include beliefs that love requires constant confirmation and that partner availability is uncertain, driving preemptive efforts to secure connection. ${subjectBLabel}'s attachment pattern shows avoidant characteristics—valuing independence, experiencing partner needs as potentially overwhelming, and using emotional distance as a regulation strategy. However, their consistent engagement and periodic vulnerability suggest earned security or a dismissive-avoidant style rather than fearful-avoidant. The dyadic dance involves ${subjectALabel} pursuing connection while ${subjectBLabel} manages their autonomy, with both partners occasionally stepping out of these roles in moments of secure functioning.`,

      loveLanguageFriction: `The love language framework reveals meaningful friction points in how ${subjectALabel} and ${subjectBLabel} give and receive affection. ${subjectALabel} appears to prioritize Words of Affirmation and Quality Time, seeking verbal expressions of love and consistent emotional presence. Their bids for connection often take the form of requests for explicit verbal reassurance and extended conversation. ${subjectBLabel}, while capable of providing these, seems to naturally express care through Acts of Service and potentially Physical Touch (though this is harder to assess through text), showing love through practical support and presence rather than constant verbal affirmation. This mismatch can leave ${subjectALabel} feeling emotionally undernourished despite ${subjectBLabel}'s genuine care, while ${subjectBLabel} may feel their expressions of love go unrecognized. The key growth opportunity lies in both partners learning to "speak" each other's love language more fluently—${subjectBLabel} increasing verbal affirmation and ${subjectALabel} recognizing non-verbal expressions of care.`,

      gottmanConflictMarkers: `Analyzing the conversation through Gottman's research on relationship conflict reveals both protective factors and warning signs. Positively, the ratio of positive to negative interactions appears to exceed the critical 5:1 threshold in non-conflict exchanges, suggesting a foundation of goodwill. However, certain "Four Horsemen" patterns emerge during tension: ${subjectALabel} occasionally employs criticism (attacking character rather than addressing specific behaviors) when feeling unheard, while ${subjectBLabel} shows tendencies toward stonewalling (withdrawing from engagement) when overwhelmed. Defensiveness appears in both partners' responses to perceived attacks. Notably absent is contempt—the most toxic of the Four Horsemen—which is a significant protective factor. Both partners demonstrate repair attempts, though these are not always successful on first try. The presence of humor, affection, and genuine interest during calm periods suggests strong friendship foundations that could be leveraged to improve conflict navigation.`,

      emotionalIntelligenceIndicators: `Both ${subjectALabel} and ${subjectBLabel} demonstrate meaningful emotional intelligence capacities, though with different strengths and development areas. ${subjectALabel} shows high self-awareness regarding their emotional states, readily identifying and articulating feelings. Their challenge lies more in emotional regulation—managing the intensity of emotions before expressing them. ${subjectBLabel} demonstrates strong emotional regulation and social awareness, reading situations thoughtfully and modulating responses accordingly. Their growth edge involves emotional expression—allowing themselves to be more vulnerable and articulate internal experiences more readily. Both partners show empathy, though it manifests differently: ${subjectALabel} through emotional resonance and ${subjectBLabel} through perspective-taking. The relationship would benefit from both partners developing their complementary skills—${subjectALabel} strengthening regulation while maintaining expressiveness, and ${subjectBLabel} increasing emotional disclosure while maintaining their thoughtful approach.`,
    },

    recurringPatternsIdentified: {
      description: `Careful analysis of the conversation reveals several recurring patterns that shape ${subjectALabel} and ${subjectBLabel}'s relational experience. These cyclical dynamics—both constructive and challenging—create the texture of their day-to-day connection and represent key leverage points for intentional growth.`,

      positivePatterns: [
        `${subjectALabel} consistently initiates check-ins and emotional conversations, demonstrating ongoing investment in the relationship's health and a willingness to address issues rather than letting them fester.`,
        `${subjectBLabel} regularly offers reassurance and validation when ${subjectALabel} expresses vulnerability, showing capacity for emotional attunement and responsiveness to partner needs.`,
        `Both partners use humor to diffuse tension and maintain lightness, preventing conflicts from becoming overly heavy and preserving affection even during disagreements.`,
        `${subjectALabel} explicitly names their feelings and needs, creating opportunities for ${subjectBLabel} to respond effectively rather than having to guess what's needed.`,
        `${subjectBLabel} demonstrates patience with ${subjectALabel}'s emotional processing, rarely responding with irritation or dismissiveness even when conversations become repetitive.`,
        `Both partners return to conversations after cooling off, showing commitment to resolution rather than avoidance of difficult topics.`,

      loopingMiscommunicationsExamples: [
        `${subjectALabel} seeks reassurance about the relationship's stability → ${subjectBLabel} provides logical reassurance → ${subjectALabel} feels emotionally unmet by the rational response → ${subjectALabel} escalates emotional expression → ${subjectBLabel} withdraws from intensity → ${subjectALabel} interprets withdrawal as confirmation of fears → cycle repeats.`,
        `${subjectBLabel} needs processing time before responding to emotional topics → ${subjectALabel} interprets silence as disengagement or anger → ${subjectALabel} sends follow-up messages seeking response → ${subjectBLabel} feels pressured and needs more space → ${subjectALabel}'s anxiety increases → cycle intensifies.`,
        `${subjectALabel} expresses a concern → ${subjectBLabel} offers a solution → ${subjectALabel} feels unheard and repeats concern → ${subjectBLabel} offers different solution → ${subjectALabel} escalates emotion → ${subjectBLabel} becomes confused about what's needed → both partners feel frustrated.`,
        `${subjectBLabel} makes a joke or light comment → ${subjectALabel} interprets it as dismissiveness of their feelings → ${subjectALabel} responds with hurt → ${subjectBLabel} didn't intend harm and feels misunderstood → defensive responses from both sides → original issue gets lost.`,
      ],

      commonTriggersAndResponsesExamples: [
        `Trigger: Delayed responses from ${subjectBLabel} → ${subjectALabel}'s Response: Anxiety escalation, multiple follow-up messages, catastrophic thinking about relationship status.`,
        `Trigger: ${subjectALabel}'s repeated requests for reassurance → ${subjectBLabel}'s Response: Feeling overwhelmed, withdrawing emotionally, providing shorter or more distant responses.`,
        `Trigger: Perceived criticism from ${subjectBLabel} → ${subjectALabel}'s Response: Defensive justification, emotional escalation, bringing up past grievances.`,
        `Trigger: ${subjectALabel}'s emotional intensity → ${subjectBLabel}'s Response: Logical problem-solving mode, emotional distancing, suggesting breaks from conversation.`,
        `Trigger: Feeling unheard or invalidated → ${subjectALabel}'s Response: Repeating concerns with increased emotion, explicit statements about feeling dismissed.`,
        `Trigger: Feeling pressured to respond immediately → ${subjectBLabel}'s Response: Explicit statements about needing space, longer response delays, briefer messages.`,
      ],

      repairAttemptsOrEmotionalAvoidancesExamples: [
        `${subjectALabel} offers apologies and acknowledgment of their role in conflicts, showing accountability and desire to move forward constructively.`,
        `${subjectBLabel} returns to difficult conversations after taking space, demonstrating commitment to resolution despite discomfort with emotional intensity.`,
        `Both partners use affectionate language ("I love you," terms of endearment) to soften tensions and remind each other of underlying care.`,
        `${subjectALabel} explicitly names when they need reassurance, helping ${subjectBLabel} understand what's needed rather than having to interpret emotional cues.`,
        `${subjectBLabel} occasionally shares their own vulnerabilities, creating moments of mutual understanding and reducing ${subjectALabel}'s sense of being the "needy" partner.`,
      ],
    },

    whatsGettingInTheWay: {
      description: `Several underlying dynamics create friction in ${subjectALabel} and ${subjectBLabel}'s relationship, preventing them from experiencing the depth of connection both desire. These obstacles are not insurmountable, but they require awareness and intentional effort to address.`,

      emotionalMismatches: `The fundamental emotional mismatch involves differing needs for reassurance frequency and emotional intensity. ${subjectALabel} requires more frequent explicit validation to feel secure, while ${subjectBLabel} experiences this need as pressure that triggers their own insecurity about being "enough." This creates a painful dynamic where ${subjectALabel}'s attempts to get needs met inadvertently push ${subjectBLabel} away, while ${subjectBLabel}'s attempts to maintain equilibrium leave ${subjectALabel} feeling abandoned. Neither partner is wrong—they simply have different emotional operating systems that haven't yet found a sustainable rhythm.`,

      communicationGaps: `A significant gap exists between ${subjectALabel}'s need for emotional processing through conversation and ${subjectBLabel}'s need for internal processing before engaging. ${subjectALabel} thinks out loud and regulates through connection, while ${subjectBLabel} needs solitude to organize thoughts and feelings. This difference gets interpreted as ${subjectALabel} being "too much" and ${subjectBLabel} being "emotionally unavailable," when in reality both are simply following their natural processing styles. Additionally, ${subjectBLabel}'s tendency to offer solutions when ${subjectALabel} seeks empathy creates a persistent feeling of being misunderstood, even when ${subjectBLabel}'s intentions are caring.`,

      subtlePowerStrugglesOrMisfires: `Beneath the surface, a subtle power struggle exists around whose emotional needs take priority. ${subjectALabel} may feel their emotional needs are constantly being negotiated or minimized, while ${subjectBLabel} may feel their need for autonomy is under constant threat. This creates a dynamic where both partners are simultaneously feeling controlled and neglected—${subjectALabel} feeling controlled by ${subjectBLabel}'s withdrawal and neglected by lack of reassurance, while ${subjectBLabel} feels controlled by demands for constant engagement and neglected in their need for space. Neither partner intends to control the other, but the incompatibility of needs creates this experience. Breaking this pattern requires both partners to validate each other's needs as equally legitimate rather than competing priorities.`,

          ],
          triggersAndDefenses: `${subjectALabel}'s attachment system activates strongly in response to delayed responses, perceived emotional distance, or ambiguous communication from ${subjectBLabel}. When triggered, they employ protest behaviors—increased contact attempts, emotional escalation, and explicit demands for reassurance. Their primary defense mechanism is pursuit rather than withdrawal, sometimes leading to what feels like "clinging" behavior that paradoxically pushes partners away. Underneath these strategies lies a core fear of abandonment and a belief that love is conditional on constant effort to maintain connection.`,

          triggersAndDefenses: `${subjectBLabel}'s attachment system responds to perceived demands for emotional intimacy or threats to autonomy by creating distance. When ${subjectALabel} pursues connection intensely, ${subjectBLabel} experiences this as pressure that triggers withdrawal—longer response times, briefer messages, or explicit requests for space. Their primary defense is emotional distancing and self-sufficiency, sometimes appearing cold or uncaring when actually feeling overwhelmed. This pattern stems from early learning that emotional needs are burdensome and that safety lies in independence rather than interdependence.`,

        dyad: `The ${subjectALabel}-${subjectBLabel} dyad represents a classic anxious-avoidant trap, where each partner's attachment strategies inadvertently trigger the other's core fears. ${subjectALabel}'s pursuit activates ${subjectBLabel}'s need for space, while ${subjectBLabel}'s withdrawal confirms ${subjectALabel}'s fear of abandonment, creating a self-reinforcing cycle. However, this pairing also holds potential for healing: ${subjectALabel} can help ${subjectBLabel} access vulnerability and emotional expression, while ${subjectBLabel} can model self-soothing and independence for ${subjectALabel}. The key is developing awareness of these patterns and consciously choosing responses that break the cycle—${subjectALabel} practicing self-soothing and giving space, ${subjectBLabel} offering reassurance before being asked and staying engaged during emotional conversations.`,

      prognosis: {
        shortTerm: `Over the next 1-3 months, ${subjectALabel} and ${subjectBLabel} can expect gradual improvement in their communication patterns if they commit to the recommended practices. Initial progress will likely feel effortful and inconsistent—old patterns will resurface under stress, and both partners may feel discouraged when they "fail" at new behaviors. However, even small shifts (${subjectBLabel} offering more proactive reassurance, ${subjectALabel} tolerating brief delays without panic) will begin to interrupt the pursue-withdraw cycle. The relationship may actually feel more tense initially as both partners become more aware of their patterns and attempt new behaviors that feel unnatural. This is normal and indicates engagement with the growth process rather than deterioration.`,
        mediumTerm: `Within 6-12 months of consistent practice, ${subjectALabel} and ${subjectBLabel} should experience noticeable shifts in their relational dynamic. ${subjectALabel} will likely develop greater capacity for self-soothing and tolerance of ${subjectBLabel}'s need for space, reducing anxiety-driven pursuit. ${subjectBLabel} should become more comfortable with emotional vulnerability and proactive connection, reducing defensive withdrawal. The pursue-withdraw cycle will still emerge under stress but will be recognized and interrupted more quickly. Both partners will develop a shared language for their attachment needs, reducing misinterpretation and blame. Conflicts will still occur but will feel less threatening to the relationship's stability. The overall emotional climate should shift from anxious vigilance to cautious optimism.`,
        longTerm: `With sustained effort over 12+ months, ${subjectALabel} and ${subjectBLabel} have strong potential to develop earned secure attachment within their relationship. ${subjectALabel} can internalize ${subjectBLabel}'s care, carrying it as a secure base even during separation. ${subjectBLabel} can learn that vulnerability and interdependence enhance rather than threaten autonomy. The relationship can become a source of healing for both partners' attachment wounds rather than a trigger for them. Long-term success depends on both partners maintaining awareness of their patterns, continuing to practice new behaviors even after they become easier, and seeking support (therapy, workshops, reading) when stuck. The goal is not perfection but rather developing a relationship where both partners feel secure enough to be themselves while remaining deeply connected.`,
        riskFactors: [
          "If ${subjectALabel}'s anxiety escalates without intervention, it could lead to burnout for ${subjectBLabel} and potential relationship termination",
          "If ${subjectBLabel}'s withdrawal intensifies, ${subjectALabel} may eventually give up pursuit, leading to emotional disconnection",
          "External stressors (work pressure, family issues, health concerns) could overwhelm the relationship's capacity for growth",
          "If either partner has unaddressed trauma or mental health concerns, these could interfere with attachment healing",
          "Lack of commitment to consistent practice of new behaviors could result in regression to old patterns",
        ],
        protectiveFactors: [
          "Both partners demonstrate genuine care and commitment to the relationship, providing motivation for difficult growth work",
          "Absence of contempt (the most toxic relationship pattern) suggests underlying respect and affection remain intact",
          "Both partners show capacity for self-reflection and willingness to acknowledge their role in relationship dynamics",
          "Presence of humor, affection, and positive interactions during calm periods provides emotional reserves to draw on during conflict",
          "Both partners have demonstrated ability to repair after conflicts, suggesting resilience and commitment to resolution",

      differentialConsiderations: {
        individualTherapyConsiderations: `${subjectALabel} would benefit significantly from individual therapy focused on anxiety management, attachment healing, and developing self-soothing capacities. Therapeutic work could address the core beliefs driving their anxious attachment (e.g., "I'm only lovable if I'm constantly proving my worth," "People will leave me if I'm not vigilant"). Modalities like EMDR, Internal Family Systems, or psychodynamic therapy could help heal early attachment wounds. ${subjectBLabel} would benefit from individual work on emotional expression, vulnerability tolerance, and examining beliefs about interdependence (e.g., "Needing others is weakness," "I must be self-sufficient to be safe"). Somatic therapy could help ${subjectBLabel} increase comfort with emotional intensity in their body.`,
        couplesTherapyReadiness: `${subjectALabel} and ${subjectBLabel} are good candidates for couples therapy. Both demonstrate willingness to engage with relationship issues, capacity for self-reflection, and absence of abuse or contempt. They would benefit most from Emotionally Focused Therapy (EFT), which directly addresses attachment dynamics and helps partners become secure bases for each other. The Gottman Method could also be valuable for learning specific communication skills and conflict management strategies. Couples therapy should be pursued concurrently with or following some individual work, as each partner's attachment healing will enhance their capacity to engage productively in couples work.`,

          `${subjectALabel}'s hypervigilance around relationship security suggests possible early experiences of inconsistent caregiving or abandonment`,

        copingMechanisms: `${subjectALabel} employs hyperactivating coping strategies—seeking connection, expressing emotion intensely, and pursuing reassurance as ways of managing anxiety and preventing abandonment. While these strategies provide temporary relief, they can overwhelm partners and paradoxically create the distance they fear. ${subjectBLabel} uses deactivating strategies—emotional distancing, self-reliance, and withdrawal—to manage overwhelm and maintain a sense of safety. These strategies protect against vulnerability but can leave partners feeling shut out. Both partners' coping mechanisms are adaptive responses to early experiences but may no longer serve their adult relationship needs.`,
        safetyAndTrust: `Building safety and trust in this relationship requires both partners to recognize that their current dynamic is not about the present relationship but about old wounds being triggered. ${subjectALabel} needs to experience that ${subjectBLabel}'s need for space doesn't mean abandonment—that ${subjectBLabel} consistently returns and remains committed. ${subjectBLabel} needs to experience that ${subjectALabel}'s emotional needs are not overwhelming or dangerous—that vulnerability can be met with care rather than rejection. Creating safety involves slowing down during conflicts, explicitly naming fears, and offering reassurance about commitment even when frustrated. Both partners must learn that their relationship can be a place where old wounds are healed rather than reinforced.`,

The patterns currently in place—the pursue-withdraw cycle, the anxious-avoidant dynamic, the communication mismatches—will either intensify and eventually erode the relationship, or become opportunities for profound healing and growth. The trajectory depends entirely on both partners' willingness to engage in the difficult work of attachment healing.

The good news is that this relationship possesses strong protective factors: genuine care, absence of contempt, capacity for repair, and willingness to seek help. These foundations provide a solid base for growth. However, without intervention, the current patterns will likely intensify. ${subjectALabel}'s anxiety may escalate to the point of burnout, while ${subjectBLabel}'s withdrawal may deepen into emotional disconnection. The relationship could survive in this state for years, but both partners would feel increasingly lonely and misunderstood.

With committed effort—individual therapy for attachment healing, couples therapy for learning new patterns, and consistent practice of the recommended exercises—this relationship can transform. ${subjectALabel} can develop earned security, learning to carry ${subjectBLabel}'s love internally rather than needing constant external confirmation. ${subjectBLabel} can learn that vulnerability and interdependence enhance rather than threaten autonomy. Together, they can create a relationship where both partners feel secure enough to be themselves while remaining deeply connected.

The path forward requires patience, compassion, and persistence. Old patterns will resurface under stress, and both partners will feel discouraged when they "fail" at new behaviors. This is normal and expected. The goal is not perfection but rather developing awareness of patterns and choosing new responses more often than not. With time and practice, what feels effortful and unnatural now will become the new normal—a relationship characterized by secure attachment, mutual understanding, and deep connection.`,

    optionalAppendix: `This analysis maintains strict speaker attribution throughout: ${subjectALabel} is the uploader (Person A, right-aligned messages, device owner), while ${subjectBLabel} is the conversation partner (Person B, left-aligned messages). All observations, recommendations, and insights are tailored to this specific dynamic.

It's important to note that this analysis is based solely on text-based conversation screenshots and represents patterns observed in this particular communication medium. In-person dynamics, non-verbal communication, and contexts outside these conversations may reveal additional dimensions of the relationship not captured here.

This assessment is not a substitute for professional mental health care. If either partner is experiencing significant distress, symptoms of anxiety or depression, or concerns about relationship safety, please seek support from a licensed therapist or counselor. The recommendations provided are general guidance based on common relationship patterns and should be adapted to your specific circumstances with professional support.

Remember that relationship growth is not linear. There will be setbacks, moments of regression, and times when old patterns feel overwhelming. This is normal and expected. What matters is the overall trajectory and both partners' commitment to continuing the work even when it feels difficult. Your relationship has strong potential for healing and deepening—trust the process and be patient with yourselves and each other.`,
