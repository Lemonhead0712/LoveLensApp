              Love Lens is an AI-powered tool that analyzes conversation patterns to provide objective insights into
              relationship dynamics. It helps couples understand communication styles, identify patterns, and discover
              growth opportunities.

              How does Love Lens work?
            </AccordionTrigger>
            <AccordionContent className="text-gray-700">
              Upload screenshots of your conversations, and our AI analyzes communication patterns, emotional tones, and
              relationship dynamics using frameworks like the Gottman Method and attachment theory. Screenshots are
              processed locally and deleted after analysisâ€”we never store your conversation content.

              Is Love Lens secure and private?
            </AccordionTrigger>
            <AccordionContent className="text-gray-700">
              Yes. Love Lens processes screenshots in memory and automatically deletes them after generating your
              analysis. We never store conversation content. All data transmission is encrypted with industry-standard
              security measures.

              Can Love Lens replace relationship therapy?
            </AccordionTrigger>
            <AccordionContent className="text-gray-700">
              No. Love Lens is informational and not a substitute for professional counseling or therapy. Use it as one
              resource among many for relationship growth. For serious relationship issues, we recommend working with a
              qualified therapist.

              What kind of screenshots should I upload?

            <AccordionContent className="text-gray-700">
              Upload text conversation screenshots from any messaging platform (SMS, WhatsApp, iMessage, etc.). For best
              results, upload multiple screenshots showing a range of interactions. Ensure text is clearly visible and
              it's clear who sent each message.

              How many screenshots should I upload?
            </AccordionTrigger>
            <AccordionContent className="text-gray-700">
              We recommend 5-10 screenshots representing different conversations over time for the most accurate
              analysis. Even a single conversation can provide insights, though results may be less reliable with very
              few messages.

              Do I need my partner's consent to use Love Lens?
            </AccordionTrigger>
            <AccordionContent className="text-gray-700">
              Yes, we strongly recommend obtaining your partner's consent. Analyzing conversations without consent could
              violate trust and potentially legal privacy rights. The most benefit comes when both partners engage with
              the insights together.
